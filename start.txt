The Ghost of Tsushima: A Story of Choices
I am Jin Sakai. When the Mongols invaded Tsushima, everything I knew was shattered. My uncle, Lord Shimura, believed in
honor, in fighting the enemy face-to-face with the code of the samurai. But I saw the destruction spreading too fast,
my people dying by the hundreds.
I had to decide who I wanted to be.
honor — I fight the Mongols with the sword, pride guiding every move, even if it means losing many lives.
survival — I become the Ghost, striking from the shadows, using stealth, fear, and whatever means necessary.
