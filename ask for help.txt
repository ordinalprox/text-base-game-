so you prepare by gather your allies and getting redy to scale the mountain and take over the mongols weponds and use it on them
as you take over the mongols weapon your uncle rams the main gate of the gate and all focus is on so you slip thought and fight the kon 1 on 1
once you have defeated the kon your uncle sends a message towards you, and he gives you a challenge to met at your family estate and fight him
so fight him or don't fight him
